# Portfolio

## Description
This is my web developer portfolio.  I wanted to create a new portfolio using React, so I could practice, and also I love the SPA (single page application) aspect of React sites.  I used create-react-app and then developed the application from there.  I still need to add some backend for the contact form - coming soon!
